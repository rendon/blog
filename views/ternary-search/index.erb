<p>Hi! This time I going to talk about a new technique I’ve just learned, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_search">Ternary Search</a>.</p>
<h2 id="ternary-search-1">Ternary search</h2>
<p>Ternary search is a technique similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">Binary Search</a> and is important since ternary search could success in situations where the binary search would fail. Time ago I was very criticized in the <a href="http://codeforces.com">Codeforces</a> forum for arguing that has no sense to use ternary search if it is not more efficient than binary search. Is not about efficiency but –said the others. Actually I meant to ternary search in arrays, to reduce the search space to a third part, etc. Now I understand what they were talking about.</p>
<h2 id="sample-problem">Sample problem</h2>
<p>You can solve the <a href="http://lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1146">1146 - Closest Distance</a> problem from <a href="http://lightoj.com">lightoj.com</a> with this technique.</p>

<p>Compute the distance between the two men as they move and take the minimum distance.</p>

<p>Obviously, we can only take discrete points, and, since the problem ask for an answer with an error less than 1e-6, a brute force approach would take much time, very much. So the strategy is to use ternary search:</p>
<p><img src="/ternary-search/ternary_search_2.png" alt="Step 1" /> <img src="/ternary-search/ternary_search_3.png" alt="Step 2" /> <img src="/ternary-search/ternary_search_4.png" alt="Step 3" /> <img src="/ternary-search/ternary_search_5.png" alt="Step 4" /></p>
<p>And so on. Here is my solution:</p>
