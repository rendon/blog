<p>Oh boy! It is so easy to implement an algorithm once you know exactly how it works :).</p>

<p>I've been trying to implement the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm" target="_blank">A*</a> algorithm and solve at least one problem with it, however, almost all sources of information are abstract and give only high level details, but I got it!</p>

<p>I don't have much time so I'm just going to leave a problem and my solution using the A* algorithm. For the theory you can count on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>. </p>

## Problem
<a href="http://lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1139" target="_blank">1139 - 8 Puzzle</a>

## Solution
Embed: `sol.cpp`
