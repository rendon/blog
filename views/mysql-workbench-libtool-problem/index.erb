I have been treating to use MySQL Workbench to design some database schemas these days, but it does crash so often that I decided to install it from the source hoping to find a more stable version, however I faced this problem:
</p>
<p>Embed: <code>make-error.txt</code></p>

I found the solution <a href="http://blog.csdn.net/kumu_linux/article/details/7957449" target="_blank" title="Solution">here</a>:
</p>
<p>&lt;%= inline_code(‘cp /usr/bin/libtool /home/user/Downloads/workbench/mysql-workbench-gpl-5.2.44-src/ext/antlr-runtime/’) %&gt;</p>
<p>
I hope it helps!
