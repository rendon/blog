# Basic data compression (and decompression) in Java
2016-02-18 2024-05-07 #dev #java #post

I needed to compress some data in Java and it took me some time to come up with a working example, so I'm  posting my code here as a reference for future uses, and possibly help somebody else in the same situation.

I hope this helps as a starting point, you can always take a look at the Java docs for more details and options.
