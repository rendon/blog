<p>I needed to compress some data in Java and it took me some time to come up with a working example, so Iâ€™m posting my code here as a reference for future uses, and possibly help somebody else in the same situation.</p>

<p>I hope this helps as a starting point, you can always take a look at the Java docs for more details and options.</p>
